🛠️ Bash Cyber Tools

All scripts in this repository were developed and executed entirely using Termux on a mobile phone as part of my self-learning journey in cybersecurity. This repo also contains my daily Bash scripting practice exercises, which I continuously update and improve.

📁 Tools List

🔹 cyberscan.sh

A simple network reconnaissance tool that can:

Check if a target is alive using ping

Perform a basic port scan with nmap

Save the results to a log file

Display the scan output in real-time

🔹 cyberscan_V1.sh

An enhanced version of cyberscan.sh with additional features:

Validates user input to ensure the target and port fields are not empty

Automatically generates timestamped log filenames to prevent overwriting

Colored output (green for success, red for errors) for better readability

Interactive prompt to view scan results using less

Clear error messages when the target is unreachable


This upgraded version is more robust, user-friendly, and practical for real-world cybersecurity learning.

📌 Personal Notes

I’m learning Bash scripting as a foundation for cybersecurity. These tools are part of my daily practice and will be improved and expanded over time as my skills grow.
